The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

            14 = 2 * 7
            15 = 3 * 5.

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

            644 = 2Â² * 7 * 23
            645 = 3 * 5 * 43
            646 = 2 * 17 * 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors
each. What is the first of these numbers?
