# along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
# with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the
# side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
# diagonals first falls below 10%?

# (1*) Inherited from Problem 28
# CASE n IS ODD
# If we enumerate the numbers that we need to sum in increasing order, we have:
# 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25.
# By observing their properties, we can group them by the difference that there
# is between them:
#             Difference of 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
#             Difference of 4: 9, 13, 17, 21, 25
# By creating a 7 x 7 spiral, we can confirm that the next numbers are:
#             Difference of 6: 25, 31, 37, 43, 49
# We need then to construct this list of numbers and then sum them:
#                         01,
#             03,  7,  5,  9, (Diff 2, 3x3)
#             13, 17, 21, 25, (Diff 4, 5x5)
#             31, 37, 43, 49, (Diff 6, 7x7)
#             etc
# And we stop when the number is n x n. Observe that when the square is n x n,
# the last four numbers have a difference of n-1, so we can use that to stop.
