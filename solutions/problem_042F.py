# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);
# so the first ten triangle numbers are:

#         1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
# alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
# example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value
# is a triangle then we shall call the word a triangle word.

# Using words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
# English words, how many are triangle words?
