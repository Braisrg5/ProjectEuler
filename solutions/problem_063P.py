For n = 2:
            10 <= x^2 < 100
            10^(1/2) <= x < 10 -> 3.16 <= x < 10 -> 4 <= x < 100

For n = 3:
            100 <= x^3 < 1000
            100^(1/3) <= x < 10 -> 4.64 <= x < 10 -> 5 <= x < 10

For an arbitrary n:
            10^(n-1) <= x^n < 10^n
            10^(n-1)^(1/n) <= x < 10
x has to be an integer, so we can take n until
